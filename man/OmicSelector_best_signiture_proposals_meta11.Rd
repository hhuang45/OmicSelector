\value{
The benchmark sorted by metaIndex. First row is the best performing miRNA set.

\description{
Propose the best signture based on benchamrk methods.
This function calculated the `metaIndex11` value which is the Youden-like score on validation set (the only one that was never used in any section of the pipeline).
Formula: `metaIndex11 = validation sensitivitiy + validation specificity - 1`
In the next step, it sorts the miRNA sets based on `metaIndex11` score. The first row in resulting data frame is the winner miRNA set.
