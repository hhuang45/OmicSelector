\usage{
OmicSelector_differential_expression_ttest(
  ttpm_features,
  classes,
  mode = "auto"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ttpm_features}{matrix of log-transformed TPM-normalized miRNAs counts or other feature matrix with miRNAs/features placed in `ttpm` design (i.e. columns and cases placed as rows)}

\item{classes}{vector describing label for each case. It should contain only "Cancer" and "Control" labeles!!!!}

\item{mode}{use 'logtpm' for log(TPM) data or 'deltact' for qPCR deltaCt values. This parameters sets how the fold-change is calculated. Setting it to "auto" will try to read settings from var_type.txt (used in docker).}
}
\value{
Data frame with results.
}
\description{
The variable performes standard differential expression analysis using unpaired t-test with BH and Bonferonni correction.
It requires `ttpm_features` object, which is e.g. a matrix of log-transformed TPM-normalized miRNAs counts with miRNAs placed in `ttpm` design (i.e. columns and cases placed as rows).
Classess should be passed as `classes` and this should be a vector of length equal to number of rows in `ttpm_polfiltrze` and contain only "Cancer" or "Control" labels!!
The function returns the miRNAs sorted by BH-corrected p-value.
